# üí´ About Me:
Hey! I'm currently a student earning my second Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University with a background that took a few creative turns before landing in tech.  I used to work as an audio engineer and spent time designing and building stormwater sampling systems across LA and San Diego Counties. Now, I'm focused on full stack and backend development, where I get to combine hands-on problem-solving with clean, scalable code.

Some projects I'm proud of:

- Wrote a custom Linux shell in C from scratch

- Wrote a program in Python that gave me surf condition updates so I could know when to take a break and hit the surf 

- Currently building a tool that compares resumes to job descriptions to help people tailor their applications

When I'm not coding, I'm usually woodworking, surfing, or cooking up something new in the kitchen. Always down to collaborate or connect about interesting projects or internship opportunities!<br><br>
